# Platform Engineers Development Environment

## Overview

This directory contains build and start scripts for the Platform Engineers' development environment.

## ⚠️ Initial Setup (One-Time)

**Before using this environment, set up Git hooks from the repository root:**

```bash
# From repository root
cd ../..
./setup-hooks.sh
```

This protects the `main` and `dev` branches from accidental pushes. See [BRANCH_PROTECTION.md](../../BRANCH_PROTECTION.md) for details.

## Services

**Primary Services:**
- ✅ **API Gateway** - Platform routing and policies
- ✅ **All Microservices** - Platform standards and tooling
- ✅ **Infrastructure Services** - Platform infrastructure

**Infrastructure Needed:**
- ✅ **All services** - For platform tooling development
- ✅ **Kubernetes** - Platform orchestration
- ✅ **CI/CD pipelines** - Platform automation

## Usage

### Build Services

```bash
./build.sh
```

This builds all services.

### Start Services

```bash
./start.sh
```

This starts everything.

### Stop Services

```bash
cd ../..
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

### Rebuild After Code Changes

```bash
./build.sh
./start.sh
```

## Quick Reference

### Setup Minikube (for Kubernetes/Skaffold builds)
```bash
# Check if Minikube is running
minikube status

# If not running, start Minikube
minikube start --driver=docker --cpus=4 --memory=8192

# Configure Docker to use Minikube's Docker daemon
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

### Build
```bash
# Build all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build

# Or use your team's build script
./build.sh
```

### When you DO need to build / rebuild
Only build if:
1. **Dockerfile changes**
2. **package.json/requirements.txt changes** (dependencies)
3. **First time setup**

**Note:** With hot reload enabled, code changes don't require rebuilds - just restart the service!

### Run all services
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### Stop all services
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

### Running only services you need for your team
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.platform-engineers.yml up -d
```

### Stopping those services
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.platform-engineers.yml down
```

### Logs (All services)
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f
```

### Logs (Individual services)
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f api-gateway
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f cyrex
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f auth-service
# ... etc for all services
```

## What You Work On

- Platform standards and best practices
- Service mesh and observability
- CI/CD pipelines
- Developer tooling
- Service templates and scaffolding
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring, tracing)
